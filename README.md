# SER316 Design Patterns Plan


Implement four design patterns together
- Factory pattern for farms
  Requirements Fullfilled by Factory Pattern
  - A world must start with at least 1 farm
  - Farms can be of 3 different types (Hybrid, Animal, Crop)
  - Runs on cycles based on user input
  - Farms automatically upgrade when required currency is obtained
  - Up to six farmers may start on a single farm. Once population is over 10, new farm is created
- Observer to notify different elements of each tick and how they should act accordingly
- Decorator to define currency and product increases dynamically
- Builder will be used to represent the animals throughout the farms
